## Size Limits

- Full SKILL.md: ≤ 100,000 chars enforced (`MAX_SKILL_CONTENT_CHARS`), but target **~100 lines for a simple skill, ~200 for a complex one**. Peer skills sit at 8-14k chars.
- Bulky or branch-specific material goes in `references/*.md`, `templates/`, or `scripts/` — pointed to from SKILL.md, not inlined.
- Don't expect the model to inline-write parsers or non-trivial logic every call — ship a helper script in `scripts/` and reference it by path.

## Body Structure (modern section order)

```
# <Skill> Skill
2-3 sentence intro: what it does, what it doesn't do, dependency stance.

## When to Use          — bulleted triggers (+ "Don't use for:" counter-triggers)
## Prerequisites        — exact env vars, installs, API key sourcing
## How to Run           — canonical invocation through the `terminal` tool
## Quick Reference      — flat command list, no narration
## Procedure            — numbered steps, each with a checkable completion criterion
## Pitfalls             — known limits, things that look broken but aren't
## Verification         — how to prove the skill worked
```

Not every section applies to every skill (a pure-procedure task skill may have no Quick Reference), but When to Use + actionable body + Pitfalls + Verification are the minimum. Cut marketing intros, "Setup Check" no-ops, and re-explanations of env vars already in Prerequisites.

### Reference Hermes tools, not raw shell

When the skill needs a capability, name the proper Hermes tool in backticks: `terminal`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `patch`, `search_files`, `web_search`, `web_extract`, `browser_navigate`, `vision_analyze`, `delegate_task`, `cronjob`. Do NOT name shell utilities the agent already has wrapped (`grep` → `search_files`, `cat` → `read_file`, `sed`/`awk` → `patch`, `find`/`ls` → `search_files target='files'`). A CLI-wrapper skill should frame invocations as `terminal(command="<tool> ...", timeout=...)` — bare shell prose ("run `foo --version`") is a review-blocking non-conformance. If the skill depends on an MCP server, name it and document setup in Prerequisites.

### Never use machine-local paths

Write repo-relative paths (`skills/...`, `tools/skill_manager_tool.py`). A `/home/<you>/...` path baked into a committed skill breaks for every other user and is an instant review flag.

## Writing Quality Principles

A skill exists to make the agent's process more predictable — the agent reliably follows the same useful discipline.

1. **Optimize for process predictability.** If a line does not change behavior, cut it.
2. **Choose the right context load.** The description is paid for every turn; details go in the body or linked references.
3. **End steps with completion criteria.** Checkable and, when it matters, exhaustive: "every modified file accounted for" beats "summarize changes."
4. **Co-locate rules with the concept they govern.**
5. **Use strong leading words** ("tight loop," "root cause," "regression test") over long repeated explanations.
6. **Prune duplication and no-ops.** "Be careful" and "use best practices" don't change model behavior — replace with a checkable criterion or delete.
