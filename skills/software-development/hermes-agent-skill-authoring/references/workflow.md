## Tests and Docs (required for repo skills)

1. **Tests** live at `tests/skills/test_<skill>_skill.py` — stdlib + pytest + `unittest.mock` only, no live network. Run via `scripts/run_tests.sh tests/skills/test_<skill>_skill.py -q`. (The generic `tests/tools/test_skill_manager_tool.py` passing proves nothing about YOUR skill.)
2. **Docs regen:** run `python website/scripts/generate-skill-docs.py`, then apply scope discipline — the generator rewrites EVERY auto-gen page. `git checkout --` everything that isn't yours; the final diff must show only your SKILL.md, your one per-skill docs page, a one-line catalog row, and a one-line `website/sidebars.ts` insertion (verify with `search_files(pattern='<your-slug>', path='website/sidebars.ts')` — exactly one hit, or the page is an orphan).
3. **`.env.example`** (only if the skill needs new env vars): one clearly delimited commented block; touch nothing else in the file.

## Workflow

1. **Survey peers** in the target category with `search_files(target='files')` and read 2-3 peer SKILL.md files to match tone and structure. Prefer extending an existing skill over creating a narrow sibling.
2. **Decide tier and category** (see above). When in doubt, optional — and ask before pushing rather than defaulting.
3. **Draft** with `write_file` to `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md` (or `optional-skills/...`).
4. **Validate locally**:
   ```python
   import yaml, re, pathlib
   content = pathlib.Path("skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md").read_text()
   assert content.startswith("---")
   m = re.search(r'\n---\s*\n', content[3:])
   fm = yaml.safe_load(content[3:m.start()+3])
   assert "name" in fm and "description" in fm
   assert len(fm["description"]) <= 60, f"description {len(fm['description'])} chars — hardline is 60"
   assert fm["description"].endswith(".")
   assert "platforms" in fm
   assert len(content) <= 100_000
   ```
   Also verify every `related_skills` entry exists in-repo.
5. **Add tests + regen docs** (previous section).
6. **Git add + commit** on the active branch; open a PR.
7. **Note:** the CURRENT session's skill loader is cached — `skill_view` / `skills_list` will not see the new skill until a new session. This is expected, not a bug.

## Editing Existing In-Repo Skills

- **Small fix:** `skill_manage(action='patch', ...)` works on in-repo skills, as does `patch`.
- **Major rewrite:** `write_file` the whole SKILL.md.
- **Supporting files:** `write_file` to `references/`, `templates/`, or `scripts/` under the skill dir.
- **Always commit** — in-repo skills are source, not runtime state. Re-run the docs generator when frontmatter changed.
