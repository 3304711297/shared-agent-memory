## Core method

Regardless of scale, every spike follows this loop:

```
decompose  →  research  →  build  →  verdict
   ↑__________________________________________↓
                  iterate on findings
```

### 1. Decompose

Break the user's idea into **2-5 independent feasibility questions**. Each question is one spike. Present them as a table with Given/When/Then framing:

| # | Spike | Validates (Given/When/Then) | Risk |
|---|-------|----------------------------|------|
| 001 | websocket-streaming | Given a WS connection, when LLM streams tokens, then client receives chunks < 100ms | High |
| 002a | pdf-parse-pdfjs | Given a multi-page PDF, when parsed with pdfjs, then structured text is extractable | Medium |
| 002b | pdf-parse-camelot | Given a multi-page PDF, when parsed with camelot, then structured text is extractable | Medium |

**Spike types:**
- **standard** — one approach answering one question
- **comparison** — same question, different approaches (shared number, letter suffix `a`/`b`/`c`)

**Good spike questions:** specific feasibility with observable output.
**Bad spike questions:** too broad, no observable output, or just "read the docs about X".

**Order by risk.** The spike most likely to kill the idea runs first. No point prototyping the easy parts if the hard part doesn't work.

**Skip decomposition** only if the user already knows exactly what they want to spike and says so. Then take their idea as a single spike.

### 2. Align (for multi-spike ideas)

Present the spike table. Ask: "Build all in this order, or adjust?" Let the user drop, reorder, or re-frame before you write any code.

### 3. Research (per spike, before building)

Spikes are not research-free — you research enough to pick the right approach, then you build. Per spike:

1. **Brief it.** 2-3 sentences: what this spike is, why it matters, key risk.
2. **Surface competing approaches** if there's real choice:

   | Approach | Tool/Library | Pros | Cons | Status |
   |----------|-------------|------|------|--------|
   | ... | ... | ... | ... | maintained / abandoned / beta |

3. **Pick one.** State why. If 2+ are credible, build quick variants within the spike.
4. **Skip research** for pure logic with no external dependencies.

Use Hermes tools for the research step:

- `web_search("python websocket streaming libraries 2025")` — find candidates
- `web_extract(urls=["https://websockets.readthedocs.io/..."])` — read the actual docs (returns markdown)
- `terminal("pip show websockets | grep Version")` — check what's installed in the project's venv

For libraries without docs pages, clone and read their `README.md` / `examples/` via `read_file`. Context7 MCP (if the user has it configured) is also a good source — `mcp_*_resolve-library-id` then `mcp_*_query-docs`.

### 4. Build

One directory per spike. Keep it standalone.

```
spikes/
├── 001-websocket-streaming/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── main.py
├── 002a-pdf-parse-pdfjs/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── parse.js
└── 002b-pdf-parse-camelot/
    ├── README.md
    └── parse.py
```

**Bias toward something the user can interact with.** Spikes fail when the only output is a log line that says "it works." The user wants to *feel* the spike working. Default choices, in order of preference:

1. A runnable CLI that takes input and prints observable output
2. A minimal HTML page that demonstrates the behavior
3. A small web server with one endpoint
4. A unit test that exercises the question with recognizable assertions

**Depth over speed.** Never declare "it works" after one happy-path run. Test edge cases. Follow surprising findings. The verdict is only trustworthy when the investigation was honest.

**Avoid** unless the spike specifically requires it: complex package management, build tools/bundlers, Docker, env files, config systems. Hardcode everything — it's a spike.

**Building one spike** — a typical tool sequence:

```
terminal("mkdir -p spikes/001-websocket-streaming")
write_file("spikes/001-websocket-streaming/README.md", "# 001: websocket-streaming\n\n...")
write_file("spikes/001-websocket-streaming/main.py", "...")
terminal("cd spikes/001-websocket-streaming && python main.py")
# Observe output, iterate.
```

**Parallel comparison spikes (002a / 002b) — delegate.** When two approaches can run in parallel and both need real engineering (not 10-line prototypes), fan out with `delegate_task`:

```
delegate_task(tasks=[
    {"goal": "Build 002a-pdf-parse-pdfjs: ...", "toolsets": ["terminal", "file", "web"]},
    {"goal": "Build 002b-pdf-parse-camelot: ...", "toolsets": ["terminal", "file", "web"]},
])
```

Each subagent returns its own verdict; you write the head-to-head.

### 5. Verdict

Each spike's `README.md` closes with:

```markdown
## Verdict: VALIDATED | PARTIAL | INVALIDATED

### What worked
- ...

### What didn't
- ...

### Surprises
- ...

### Recommendation for the real build
- ...
```

**VALIDATED** = the core question was answered yes, with evidence.
**PARTIAL** = it works under constraints X, Y, Z — document them.
**INVALIDATED** = doesn't work, for this reason. This is a successful spike.
