## Comparison spikes

When two approaches answer the same question (002a / 002b), build them **back to back**, then do a head-to-head comparison at the end:

```markdown
## Head-to-head: pdfjs vs camelot

| Dimension | pdfjs (002a) | camelot (002b) |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Extraction quality | 9/10 structured | 7/10 table-only |
| Setup complexity | npm install, 1 line | pip + ghostscript |
| Perf on 100-page PDF | 3s | 18s |
| Handles rotated text | no | yes |

**Winner:** pdfjs for our use case. Camelot if we need table-first extraction later.
```

## Frontier mode (picking what to spike next)

If spikes already exist and the user says "what should I spike next?", walk the existing directories and look for:

- **Integration risks** — two validated spikes that touch the same resource but were tested independently
- **Data handoffs** — spike A's output was assumed compatible with spike B's input; never proven
- **Gaps in the vision** — capabilities assumed but unproven
- **Alternative approaches** — different angles for PARTIAL or INVALIDATED spikes

Propose 2-4 candidates as Given/When/Then. Let the user pick.

## Output

- Create `spikes/` (or `.planning/spikes/` if the user is using GSD conventions) in the repo root
- One dir per spike: `NNN-descriptive-name/`
- `README.md` per spike captures question, approach, results, verdict
- Keep the code throwaway — a spike that takes 2 days to "clean up for production" was a bad spike
