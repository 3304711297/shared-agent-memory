## The Process

### Phase 1 — Identify the changes

Capture the diff to review. Pick the source by what the user asked for, in
this default order:

```bash
# 1. Default: uncommitted working-tree changes (tracked files)
git diff

# 2. If that's empty, include staged changes
git diff HEAD

# 3. Scoped variants the user may request:
git diff --staged                 # "staged changes"
git diff HEAD~1                    # "the last commit"
git diff main...HEAD              # "this branch" / "my PR"
git diff -- src/foo.py            # specific file(s)
```

If `git diff` and `git diff HEAD` are both empty and there's no git repo or no
changes, fall back to the files the user explicitly named or that were
recently created/edited in this session. If you genuinely can't find any
changed code, say so and stop — there's nothing to simplify.

Capture the full diff text. Note its size: if it's very large (say >2000
changed lines), warn the user that four subagents each carrying the full diff
will be token-heavy, and offer to scope it down (per-directory, per-commit)
before proceeding.
